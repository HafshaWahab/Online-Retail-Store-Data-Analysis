## Background
In this project, we have been asked to review the data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyse the major contributing factors to the revenue to plan for next year strategically. The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas which are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on whatâ€™s working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information available in the data. This dashboard analyses the complete sales, revenue and demographics of an online store for the year 2011 excluding the United Kingdom data. It is prepared by using Power BI and Power Query Editor.
